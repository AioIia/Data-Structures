## What's Inside

- **Intro**: Core Python basics — variables, loops, functions, and types.  
- **Classes**: Create custom data types with object-oriented programming.  
- **Arrays**: Efficient data access and storage with lists and arrays.  
- **Recursion**: Self-calling functions for tasks like search and sorting.  
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic, sequential structures beyond Python lists.  
- **Stacks**: LIFO structures used in parsing and backtracking.  
- **Queues**: FIFO logic for scheduling and real-time processing.
